# Try-Catch-Chess-Challenge
Python code to solve Try Catch's chess challenge

The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions MÃ—N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Assume the colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.

The program takes as input:
The dimensions of the board: M, N
The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

As output, the program should list all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board without threatening each other.
